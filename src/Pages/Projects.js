              description="The object of this game is to be the first person to score 100 points. The game-play involves rolling dice and adding the total each time. However, there is a complication which gives the game its entertainment value.  A player scores points by rolling the dice and finding the total of the dots. For example, if a player rolls a 4 and 5, they score 9.  At this point they can choose to either:  roll again and continue adding to this score, or Hold (STOP) and keep the score of 9 for their first round. Continuing to add will obviously increase the total. However, there is a catch. If a 1 appears on any dice it will wipes out all of their total score for the entire game."
